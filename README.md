docker-compose up -d

possible future improvements:
- proper url validation in backend. maybe automatic testing on creation if url is valid/exists
- authentication (+ user system? admin, "normal" user, etc.)
- confirmation dialog on delete/activate/deactivate in frontend
- integration tests
- frontend tests
- simple payment service uses development server (if only used for testing, this is fine)
